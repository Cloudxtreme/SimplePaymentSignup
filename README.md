### Description
This application is a prototype for a larger system that will act like SmashGG's registration system.
This application is meant to provide this service to Tournament Organizers of local level tournaments. 
#### Problem: 
Organizers of locals have trouble ensuring pre registration participants show up unless they have a stake already placed in the tournament. Because of this, we should force a non-refundable pre-registration fee (typically acting as the venue fee) to give people an incentive to show up to something they've said they are committed to.
#### Solution
When players fill out a preregistration form, they must pay the venue fee up front. This gives them an incentive not to just talk about coming. The fee should be non-refundable, or maybe partially refundable.
